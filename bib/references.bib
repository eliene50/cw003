  abstract = {The aim of each museum is to present its exhibits in a way that enhances the visitor experience, satisfaction and knowledge. This objective is difficult to achieve, especially in museums with a very large number of exhibits and visitors. One possible solution is to use the modern Internet and mobile technologies in order to implement a service for personalized information delivery. The content that is delivered to visitors should be consistent with their preferences and free time. The paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) － based solution for delivering personalized content to museum visitors, which includes: (1) Mobile app for visitors and curators; (2) Sensor network; and (3) Edge Computing Gateway. The main advantages of this solution are the following: platform independent service thanks to its full-stack JavaScript architecture; the service allows visitors to use it in multiple museums, not just in a particular museum; the service does not require permanent Internet access to operate; ability to deliver personalized content during the movement of visitors along the exhibits; relatively low price of the service thanks to the used hardware and open source software. Preliminary experiments in simulated and real environments show that proposed solution can be successfully used to create personalized content delivery services in smart museums.},

  abstract = {This project is conducted based on the Nawacita policy from President Joko Widodo. Tourists tend to explore the attraction independently instead of using a tour guide, but there are minimum supporting facilities because of the limitations of detailed information on tourist attraction in various languages that are not interesting and less interactive. The objectives of the research are to develop an Internet of Things based mobile application named eTourGuide that uses a location-based service to get information about the content interestingly and interactively inside a museum. The location-based service uses beacon that broadcast Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. Development of the research includes several experiments for gathering the data optimally. After completing the development, user experience questionnaire is required to evaluate the result of user’s experience after using the application. The result shows positive results of user’s experience after using the application},

  abstract = {There are many environmental monitoring challenges in cultural heritage requiring custom measurements that can be performed inconspicuously and viewed remotely. Here a flexible, inexpensive approach to wireless environmental monitoring is demonstrated, based on wireless sensor networks and an internet-of-things approach to the software architecture. The setup brings benefits such as remote logging and viewing of data on existing cloud services, low cost compared to commercial devices, customizability, and more user-friendliness than other similar devices. The approach is presented in the context of commercially available technology and relevant measurement problems within cultural heritage institutions and related cultural heritage research. The system's potential is demonstrated with an application monitoring light levels in a museum case, which is subject to permanent room lighting, motion-triggered lighting, and a skylight.},

What are its characteristics? This paper utilizes EEG signals and the PAD emotional model as research methods to conduct real-time digital measurement of visitors' emotional experiences at Tianyi Pavilion Museum in Ningbo City, focusing on their physiological and psychological reactions.The results show that: (1) In a quasi-experimental environment, linear SVM, polynomial kernel SVM, and Gaussian kernel SVM can all accurately classify the emotional tendencies of museum visitors with success rate of over 72%. (2) In a quasi-experimental environment, it is feasible and reliable to measure the immediate digital emotional experiences of visitors using EEG signals and the PAD emotion model. Based on this, we can summarize the characteristics of emotional tendencies among different demographic groups of museum visitors.},

  abstract = {Designer-oriented space design has been transferred to user-oriented space design that considers users′ emotions as well as the functions of the space, producing a multi-sensory space. Further, with the advent of embedded digital media and information technology in a space, various interface functions of the space have been developed and the user experience in the space has been much extended. This research investigated user experience and emotional aspects of a space′s design, which have been sparsely researched previously. Further, authors emphasize not only the emotion expression of the space, but also the interaction of people and space for the embodiment of the emotions from a wider perspective. Authors reviewed multidisciplinary literatures and compared various methodologies of measurement. Based on the understanding of the studies on the measurement of emotion, authors developed measures of emotion in interaction associated with spaces. The strength of the research is the focus on the integration of the space with technologies and user experiences from a new perspective in emotion research, rather than concentrating only on the architecture components of the buildings themselves. Through empirical studies, the measurements of emotion in architectural spaces can be verified and elaborated.},

  abstract = {Among the infinite options that are only limited by one's creativity, many different applications are flourishing in the context of cultural heritage. In fact, while cultural heritage is often hard to understand or even only to reach, technology is today providing all with a powerful access key to many of its very different instances. Such key can be based on traditional means of communication and explanation (e.g., audio guides), or also ambitiously exploit novel ways of representation and visualization (e.g., augmented reality renderings). Our contribution in this area is that of designing and implementing a mobile app that supports the navigation of Giuseppe Verdi-related cultural sites. Unlike any other app, ours proposes an innovative human-computer interaction scheme that supports mood-based browsing of cultural information across multiple museums at once. In practice, our app is capable of determining a user's mood and, based on such information, of providing visit suggestions as well as accessibility to content that matches the given mood state.},

  abstract = {Facial expressions of emotion are signals of high biological value. Whilst recognition of facial expressions has been much studied in central vision, the ability to perceive these signals in peripheral vision has only seen limited research to date, despite the potential adaptive advantages of such perception. In the present experiment, we investigate facial expression recognition and detection performance for each of the basic emotions (plus neutral) at up to 30 degrees of eccentricity. We demonstrate, as expected, a decrease in recognition and detection performance with increasing eccentricity, with happiness and surprised being the best recognized expressions in peripheral vision. In detection however, while happiness and surprised are still well detected, fear is also a well detected expression. We show that fear is a better detected than recognized expression. Our results demonstrate that task constraints shape the perception of expression in peripheral vision and provide novel evidence that detection and recognition rely on partially separate underlying mechanisms, with the latter more dependent on the higher spatial frequency content of the face stimulus.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the beneficial outcomes that visitors seek and obtain from a museum visit, in terms that are not related to learning outcomes. It uses a deductive qualitative approach to investigate the meaning and value of a museum visit from the visitors' perspective. Three different levels of the meaning of the experience are considered: the attributes of the setting that visitors value; the experiences they engage in; and the benefits they derive. The findings confirm the importance of the “satisfying experiences” framework for understanding visitor experiences in museums, and extend this understanding in relation to the beneficial outcomes these experiences produce. The study also highlights the importance of “restoration” as an outcome of a museum visit. It is argued that the concept of the museum as a restorative environment, which enables visitors to relax and recover from the stresses of life, is worthy of further research attention. These insights will enable museum practitioners to better understand and meet their visitors' multiple needs and expectations.},

  abstract = {Conventional studies on the satisfaction of museum visitors focus on collecting information through surveys to provide a one-way service to visitors, and thus it is impossible to obtain feedback on the real-time satisfaction of visitors who are experiencing the museum exhibition program. In addition, museum practitioners lack research on automated ways to evaluate a produced content program's lifecycle and its appropriateness. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel multi-convolutional neural network, called VimoNet, which is able to recognize visitors emotions automatically in real-time based on their facial expressions and body gestures. Furthermore, we design a user preference model of content and a framework to obtain feedback on content improvement for providing personalized digital cultural heritage content to visitors. Specifically, we define seven emotions of visitors and build a dataset of visitor facial expressions and gestures with respect to the emotions. Using the dataset, we proceed with feature fusion of face and gesture images trained on the DenseNet-201 and VGG-16 models for generating a combined emotion recognition model. From the results of the experiment, VimoNet achieved a classification accuracy of 84.10%, providing 7.60% and 14.31% improvement, respectively, over a single face and body gesture-based method of emotion classification performance. It is thus possible to automatically capture the emotions of museum visitors via VimoNet, and we confirm its feasibility through a case study with respect to digital content of cultural heritage.},

The aim of this study was to discover a potential relationship between visual and aural stimuli and emotions to provide guidelines for the design of sensory museum experiences. To do so, the study used self-report and psychophysiological measures (skin conductance rate, zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii activity). The results indicated sound and visual stimulus to be equally accurate in inducing specific emotions on the self-report measures, while psychophysiological measures showed sound to cause higher arousal than visual stimuli for the majority of the emotions, joy to be more strongly elicited by means of sound, while sadness by visual stimuli. Guidelines for the designers of sensory museum experiences are provided at the end of the article. Future studies should try to confirm these findings on a more representative sample, using neuroimaging techniques.},
